## Highlighted Projects

### HuskyReads: Project Manager and Back-End Team Lead

HuskyReads is a book catologuing website where users can find book information (authors, genres, isbn, etc.) and track which books they plan to read, have already read, and are currently reading. The front-end utilizes *React* and the backend uses *Node.js* and a *MySQL database*.

### IoT Temperature Monitor: Solo Developer

This project monitors the temperature of one or more environments and alerts the user when an environment's temperature is outside the user defined bounds. It was created to monitor reptile cages so that pet owners can be immediately notified when their pet's environment is no longer safe and needs to be rectified. It uses a WiFi enabled arduino device to measure temperatures and a *Node.js* webserver to analyse the measuered temperatures. All alerts are made using [IFTTT's](https://ifttt.com) alert service.

## Husky Coding Project

The Husky Coding Project is a University of Washington RSO created to provide students with experiences that simulate internships. We accomplish this goal by facilitating the creation of student-led group projects where students can create meaningful, and larger-scale applications that they can show-off while job-hunting. As a club leader, I have mentored multiple of these groups and focused on project idea brainstorming, project specification creation, and code developement. In addition to mentoring, I have worked as an HCP education team lead and onboarding team lead. Through these roles I have thoroughly documented HCP's onboarding processes and created and presented 5 workshops covering a wide range of technical topics.

### Workshops I Hosted

1. Docker
2. Command Line and Git
3. Technical Resume
